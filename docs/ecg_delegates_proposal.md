# ECG Delegates Proposal

Creating and Supporting an international Working Group on development of ECG Software Tools.

## Goal

Development of [Open Source, modular, user-friendly, multi-language, mobile, beautiful software tools](https://github.com/sinnwerkstatt/gemeinwohl-oekonomie#development-principles) for the ECG.

## Development Principles

The working group works according to the following development principles: https://github.com/sinnwerkstatt/gemeinwohl-oekonomie#development-principles

* **Freedom and Openness**: We share openly the strategic, organizational and technical development of the software tools. All software tools are open source and the users have the freedom to install them on their own computers and use the databases they like.
* **Modularity**: The tools are developed modularly so that changes are easy to make, e.g. change the contents of the structure of the ECG Matrix or its contents.
* **Automation**: Automation, software architecture and modularity enable us to change easily the matrix strucutre and data (in the JSON and HTML  files) and run scripts that automatically generate the whole ECG interactive matrix and mobile application. On changes of the contents and matrix data, the software tools can be generated automatically through automation. We automate as many manual tasks as possible.
* **User-friendly**: enable shortest possible path from a desire to result. The software tools are simple, clean and beautiful.
* **Lean development**: no bureaucracy, no barriers to participation, no waste of time. Focus on creating real value. Communication in GitHub. Preferred is open communicatino than private.
* **Cooperation**: everyone is welcome to contribute - make suggestions, share needs, co-develop the software: https://github.com/sinnwerkstatt/gemeinwohl-oekonomie/blob/master/README.md#contribute. We document as much as possible to make cooperation easy. The working group is open for everyone, and is active locally as well as internationally through the Internet.

## Status Quo

### Software

#### The interactive ECG Matrix

The [interactive ECG Matrix](http://sinnwerkstatt.github.io/gemeinwohl-oekonomie/#matrix) presents [the guidelines for the Common Good report](http://gemeinwohl-oekonomie.org/sites/default/files/guidlines_short_ecg_report_en.pdf) (60 pages PDF) online, user-friendly und interactively. The users sees the ECG matrix and through clicking on an indicator can learn immediately more about the goals, motivational questions, evaluation table and other important infos about the ECG indicators. The user can send link of every indicator information to a friend, e.g. this is [the link to the evaluation table of C1, workplace quality and affirmative action](http://sinnwerkstatt.github.io/gemeinwohl-oekonomie/#matrix-c1-table).

Here is [the current Roadmap](https://github.com/sinnwerkstatt/gemeinwohl-oekonomie#roadmap).

#### Mobile ECG Application

The [Mobile ECG Application](https://github.com/sinnwerkstatt/economy-common-good-mobile#economy-for-the-common-good---mobile-app) shows all important informations about the ECG on a smartphone. The [20 principles](http://gemeinwohl-oekonomie.org/en/content/20-principles-guiding-economy-common-good), [the Vision](http://gemeinwohl-oekonomie.org/en/content/vision-and-mission), [history](http://gemeinwohl-oekonomie.org/en/content/bottom-democratic-process) and [the interactive ECG Matrix](http://sinnwerkstatt.github.io/gemeinwohl-oekonomie/#matrix).

Here is [the current Roadmap](https://github.com/sinnwerkstatt/economy-common-good-mobile#roadmap).

#### ECG Quick Test

The [ECG Quick Test](http://gemeinwohl-oekonomie.org/sites/default/files/Schnelltest-Matrix4.1-final-1.2.pdf) can be [taken online](http://sinnwerkstatt.github.io/gemeinwohl-oekonomie/test.html#).

#### Online ECG Balancing Webb App

The ECG Balancing is a learning process involving ECG companies, peer companies, workers, consultants and auditors in the creation of the ECG balanace and ECG report. [The ECG Balancing Web App](https://github.com/sinnwerkstatt/gemeinwohl-oekonomie#ecg-balancing-web-application) makes the whole process transparent, simplifies and automatizes it through:

* Saving the balancing and report data in a desirable database.
* [Visualizing the ECG report](http://sinnwerkstatt.github.io/gemeinwohl-oekonomie/storage.html).
* Assigning [read, edit, comment, und audit roles to users](http://creately.com/diagram/hlvynl1f1/MA9GKxHvxTVAKUOax04wCo1pbQc%3D).
* Sending automatically relevant notifications to users during the whole process.
* Publications of ECG balances.
* Other funcationalities are possible and will be co-defined during the further development.

Status: [a first prototype is online](http://sinnwerkstatt.github.io/gemeinwohl-oekonomie/storage.html#).

Here is [the current roadmap](https://github.com/sinnwerkstatt/gemeinwohl-oekonomie#roadmap-1).

### People and Needs

We are working together with:

* Software developers: currently Nikolay Georgiev. Looking for more international involvment.
* ECG Berlin
* Christian Kozina (ECG IT Coordination)
* Gus Hagelberg (WG ECG Translation)
* WG Company Faciliation Berlin.
* [ECG affin Companies](https://github.com/sinnwerkstatt/gemeinwohl-oekonomie/blob/master/docs/ECG_Online_Balancing_Roadmap_de.md#unternehmen). Looking for ECG/Pioneer companies.
* Looking for cooperation with ECG Consultants.
* Looking for cooperation with ECG Audit people.

### Next Steps

* Financing and development of the [ECG Online Balancing Web App](https://github.com/sinnwerkstatt/gemeinwohl-oekonomie#roadmap-1). Looking for ECG Consultants and Companies.
* English version of the interactive ECG matrix and ECG mobile app.
* Improvement of the quick test.


## Rationale

### Rationale of the Software Tools

The interactive ECG matrix offers an user-friendly, practical way to navigate the ECG manual and learn more about the ECG. The mobile ECG application makes it easy to read and learn on the way and share infos with friends or people who are interested in the ECG. You can share all 200 pages of the manual, including the goals, description and evaluation tables of every ECG indicator. Valuable ECG information, easy to share online and offline.

The quick test was developed because of the desire of ECG Consultants and ECG active people in order for companies to quickly get in touch with the core ECG questions of the 17 ECG indicators. The quick test is suitable for demonstrations during talks, fairs etc.

As alternative to paper and Word/Excel documents work, the online balacing web application offers an online place for the company workers, executives, peer companies and ECG consultants to cooperatively, coordinatively, transparently and easily read, edit, comment and evaluate ECG balances and ECG reports. It can be extended even to take inputs and feedbacks from the crowd. The ECG reports could also be visualized in the mobile application.

### Rationale of the Proposal

* Share about the open international working group.
* Cooperate internationally with other stakeholders
* Connect resources and synergies for the further development.
* Profesionalize the software tools.
* Better use of our time and engagement.
